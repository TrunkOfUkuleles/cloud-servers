### The struggle
had the big issue with the roles, that seems to have been worked out, but I am stoill not deployed for a whole new reason. got the basic structure up both ways, but don't see the server actually functioning yet. Honestly, I am feeling sick, so I am going to try again tomorrow. That being said,I am interested in getting a feel for this as I think it is a good tool to have.
